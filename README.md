# What this is

A Deno cli that opens twitch channels using a URL that does not load twitch's chat or extensions. Also has some commands, such as viewing your followers list. More commands
will be implemented the more I use it. It may also be converted to a Deno package.

## Why

Because twitch chat and it's extensions use a lot of resources. Viewing streams in this manner conserves battery life if you're on a laptop.
